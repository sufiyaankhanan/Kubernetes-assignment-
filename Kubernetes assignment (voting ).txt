1. No difference seen in application after deleting vote pod . However when checked it had created new vote pod
kubectl delete po vote-94849dc97-w2xdl

2.After deleting worker pod no difference observed in application it was working fine. However new pod was created.
kubectl delete po worker-dd46d7584-rm8mg

3.After deleting the DB pod I was able to vote in application but the result page was stuck and wasnâ€™t updating. I observed a new db created after deleting the db.
 kubectl delete po db-b54cd94f4-7d9x5

4. Worker node restarted after deleting the DB.
5. Result app stopped working as the old DB was deleted which was synchronously connected to result app. Hence it was not getting values from new db.
 Result logs after deleting db:
Error performing query: error: relation "votes" does not exist
Error performing query: error: relation "votes" does not exist
Error performing query: error: relation "votes" does not exist
Error performing query: error: relation "votes" does not exist
Error performing query: Error: This socket has been ended by the other party

6.In order make result work properly I deleted the result pod hence new result pod was created which started pointing to the new db and hence the db pod started working properly.
kubectl delete po result-5d57b59f4b-vzm5r

Result logs after restart:
